### Data Mining Project for Business Improvement
Welcome to my data mining project! As the newly appointed data scientist at our company, my mission is to harness the power of data to uncover relevant, non-trivial, and valuable insights that can drive business improvement. 
In this project, I have designed and implemented a comprehensive data mining pipeline aimed at improving our products and boosting sales.

### Project Overview
In this project, I have followed a structured approach to extract actionable knowledge from a chosen dataset. The key components of this project include:
